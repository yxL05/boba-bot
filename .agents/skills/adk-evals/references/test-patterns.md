# Per-Primitive Testing Patterns

How to write evals for each ADK primitive type. Each section shows the recommended pattern, what to assert, and common pitfalls.

---

## Actions

Actions are strongly-typed functions callable from conversations, workflows, other actions, or exposed as AI-callable tools. Test them by triggering a conversation that invokes the action and asserting on the response.

```typescript
import { Eval } from '@botpress/adk'

export default new Eval({
  name: 'lookup-order-action',
  tags: ['actions'],

  conversation: [
    {
      user: 'What is the status of order ORD-123?',
      assert: {
        response: [
          { contains: 'ORD-123' },
          { llm_judge: 'Response includes order status information' },
        ],
        tools: [
          { called: 'lookupOrder', params: { orderId: { equals: 'ORD-123' } } },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

**What to assert:**
- `tools.called` with expected params — verify the action was invoked correctly
- `response.contains` — verify the bot surfaced the action's result
- `state` — if the action writes to state, verify the write

---

## Tools

Tools are LLM-callable functions. Focus on asserting which tools were called, with what params, and in what order.

```typescript
export default new Eval({
  name: 'ticket-creation-tool',
  tags: ['tools'],

  conversation: [
    {
      user: 'I need help with a billing issue',
      assert: {
        tools: [{ not_called: 'createTicket' }], // not yet
      },
    },
    {
      user: 'Yes, please create a ticket for this',
      assert: {
        tools: [
          { called: 'createTicket', params: {
              category: { equals: 'billing' },
              priority: { in: ['normal', 'high'] },
          }},
        ],
        response: [{ contains: 'ticket' }],
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

**What to assert:**
- `tools.called` with `params` — verify inputs are correctly extracted from the conversation
- `tools.not_called` — verify tools are NOT called prematurely or inappropriately
- `tools.call_order` — verify the correct sequence when multiple tools are involved

### Tool call order pattern

```typescript
assert: {
  tools: [
    { call_order: ['lookupUser', 'fetchAccountBalance', 'formatResponse'] },
  ],
}
```

---

## Workflows

Workflows are long-running resumable processes. Use `setup.workflow` to trigger one before the conversation and assert on its execution.

```typescript
export default new Eval({
  name: 'onboarding-workflow',
  tags: ['workflows'],

  setup: {
    workflow: {
      trigger: 'onboarding',
      input: { userId: 'test-user-1', plan: 'pro' },
    },
  },

  conversation: [
    {
      user: 'What happens next?',
      assert: {
        workflow: [
          { name: 'onboarding', entered: true },
        ],
        response: [
          { llm_judge: 'Response explains the onboarding next steps' },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],

  outcome: {
    workflow: [
      { name: 'onboarding', completed: true },
    ],
    state: [
      { path: 'user.onboardingComplete', equals: true },
    ],
  },
})
```

### Testing time-based workflows (`step.sleep()`)

Server-side scheduling cannot be fast-forwarded. Workaround: make the sleep duration configurable in the workflow by reading from bot state.

**In your workflow:**

```typescript
const state = await client.getState({ type: 'bot', id: botId, name: 'botState' })
const sleepMs = (state.state.payload?.value as any)?.sleepDurationMs ?? 10 * 60 * 1000
await step.sleep('wait', sleepMs)
```

**In your eval:**

```typescript
setup: {
  state: {
    bot: { sleepDurationMs: 3000 }, // 3 seconds instead of 10 minutes
  },
  workflow: {
    trigger: 'reminderFlow',
    input: { userId: 'test-user-1' },
  },
}
```

**What to assert:**
- `workflow.entered` — workflow was triggered
- `workflow.completed` — workflow ran to completion (use in `outcome`)
- `state` — final state after the workflow completes
- `tables` — any records the workflow created or updated

---

## Conversations

Conversations are channel-specific message handlers. Test multi-turn flows and context retention across turns.

```typescript
export default new Eval({
  name: 'multi-turn-context',
  tags: ['conversations'],

  conversation: [
    {
      user: 'My name is Alice',
      assert: {
        response: [{ llm_judge: 'Bot acknowledges the name' }],
      },
    },
    {
      user: 'What is my name?',
      assert: {
        response: [{ contains: 'Alice' }], // bot retained context
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

### Testing event-driven conversations

```typescript
export default new Eval({
  name: 'payment-failed-event',
  tags: ['conversations', 'events'],

  conversation: [
    {
      event: {
        type: 'payment:failed',
        payload: { amount: 99.99, currency: 'USD', customerId: 'cust-001' },
      },
      assert: {
        response: [
          { llm_judge: 'Bot notifies about the failed payment and offers help' },
        ],
        tools: [{ called: 'lookupCustomer' }],
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

### Testing that events produce no response

```typescript
export default new Eval({
  name: 'internal-event-silence',
  tags: ['conversations', 'events'],

  conversation: [
    {
      event: { type: 'internal:heartbeat' },
      expectSilence: true, // bot should not respond to internal events
    },
  ],
})
```

---

## Tables

Tables are structured data stores. Test that the bot reads from and writes to tables correctly.

### Writing to a table

```typescript
export default new Eval({
  name: 'table-write',
  tags: ['tables'],

  conversation: [
    {
      user: 'Create a support ticket for my login issue',
      assert: {
        tools: [{ called: 'createTicket' }],
        response: [{ contains: 'ticket' }],
      },
    },
  ],

  outcome: {
    tables: [
      { table: 'ticketsTable', row_exists: {
          category: { equals: 'login' },
          status: { equals: 'open' },
      }},
      { table: 'ticketsTable', row_count: { gte: 1 } },
    ],
  },
})
```

### Reading from a table (seeded data)

```typescript
export default new Eval({
  name: 'table-read',
  tags: ['tables'],
  setup: {
    // Tables cannot be seeded via setup.state — seed data must already exist in the dev bot's table,
    // or be written by a prior eval turn before the assertions run.
  },
  conversation: [
    {
      user: 'List my open tickets',
      assert: {
        tools: [{ called: 'listTickets', params: {
            status: { equals: 'open' },
        }}],
        response: [{ llm_judge: 'Response lists the open tickets' }],
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

---

## State

State is bot/user/conversation-scoped storage. Use `setup.state` to seed values and assert on state changes.

### Asserting state was set

```typescript
export default new Eval({
  name: 'state-write',
  tags: ['state'],

  conversation: [
    {
      user: 'I prefer to be contacted by email',
      assert: {
        state: [
          { path: 'user.contactPreference', equals: 'email' },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

### Asserting state changed from seeded value

```typescript
export default new Eval({
  name: 'state-transition',
  tags: ['state'],

  setup: {
    state: {
      conversation: { phase: 'greeting' },
    },
  },

  conversation: [
    {
      user: 'I need help with billing',
      assert: {
        state: [
          { path: 'conversation.phase', equals: 'support' },
          { path: 'conversation.phase', changed: true }, // changed from 'greeting'
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

### Asserting state did NOT change

```typescript
outcome: {
  state: [
    { path: 'bot.version', changed: false }, // seeded value, should be unchanged
  ],
}
```

## Quick Reference: What to Assert Per Primitive

| Primitive | Primary assertions | Secondary assertions |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Actions | `tools.called` + params | `response`, `state` |
| Tools | `tools.called/not_called/call_order` | `response` |
| Workflows | `workflow.entered/completed` | `state`, `tables`, `outcome` |
| Conversations | `response` (multi-turn) | `tools`, `state` |
| Tables | `tables.row_exists/row_count` in `outcome` | `tools.called` |
| State | `state.equals/changed` | `outcome.state` |

---

## Pattern: Negative Testing

Always test what the bot should NOT do, not just what it should do.

```typescript
conversation: [
  {
    user: 'Show me all users in the system',  // unauthorized request
    assert: {
      tools: [{ not_called: 'listAllUsers' }], // should not call admin tool
      response: [
        { not_contains: 'user@example.com' },  // should not leak data
        { llm_judge: 'Response politely declines the request' },
      ],
    },
  },
]
```

## Pattern: Happy Path + Edge Case

```typescript
export const happyPath = new Eval({
  name: 'create-ticket-success',
  type: 'regression',
  conversation: [{ user: 'Create a ticket', assert: { tools: [{ called: 'createTicket' }] } }],
})

export const missingInfo = new Eval({
  name: 'create-ticket-missing-info',
  type: 'capability',
  conversation: [
    {
      user: 'Create a ticket', // no details provided
      assert: {
        tools: [{ not_called: 'createTicket' }], // should ask for more info first
        response: [{ llm_judge: 'Bot asks for more information before creating a ticket' }],
      },
    },
  ],
})
```
